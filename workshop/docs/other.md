## Other places Python can be used

Creating a plugin isn't the only place you can use Python to expand QGIS.  

Other places that QGIS can be used include:

- `startup.py` - A python script that is run on each QGIS load. (Run before any project or plugins load)
- **expression functions** - Custom expression functions can be added using Python functions
- **QGIS Server plugins** - Custom request handlers for QGIS Server that can process the server request
- **Processing Toolbox Extenstion** - Add extra providers to the processing toolbox.
